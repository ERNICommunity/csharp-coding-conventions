# ERNI C# Coding Conventions

## About
This document describes C# coding conventions we are using in ERNI Service Delivery Centers.

## Motivation
Maintainability.

## General Principles

### Readability
Code is written once but read thousand times. Therefore our first principle is to always optimize code for reading.

### Simplicity
Change on one line should not require changing other lines.

### No dogma dogma
Every principle and every rule can be broken when there is a good reason for it **and** that reason is well documented.
