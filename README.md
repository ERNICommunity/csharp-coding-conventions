You are welcome to contribute to this product. You can contribute by entering an issue or submitting a pull request

### Issues

 * Do not enter duplicate issues. Always check, if anyone else have entered similar issue to yours.
 * Make sure issue is well documented.
 * When requesting a new feature or change request make sure the issue has proper foundation (reference and article, research, statistics, etc.). Do not argument with _"Because I want..."_. The same is true for commenting on issues. This is especially true for issues to make decission.

### Pull requests

You are very welcome to not only enter an issue, but also to propose a solution by pull request. For example a pull request to update a ruleset file. Same rules as for documenting issues apply to pull requests.
